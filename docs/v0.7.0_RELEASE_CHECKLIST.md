- [ ] Tag visible on GitHub
- [ ] Release notes properly formatted
- [ ] `go get github.com/ZaguanLabs/xai-sdk-go@v0.7.0` works

## Post-Release

### Communication
- [ ] Update README.md with latest version badge (if applicable)
- [ ] Announce on relevant channels (Discord, Slack, etc.)
- [ ] Update documentation site (if applicable)

### Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor GitHub issues for migration problems
- [ ] Watch for build failures in dependent projects
- [ ] Respond to questions about breaking changes

## Breaking Changes Summary

### For Users
**Impact**: LOW - Most users won't be affected

**Affected Users**: Only those who explicitly use these type aliases:
- `image.ImageInput` → `image.Input`
- `chat.ChatServiceClient` → `chat.ServiceClient`

**Migration**: Simple find-and-replace, compile-time errors

### For Maintainers
**Benefits**:
- Cleaner, more idiomatic Go API
- Reduced cyclomatic complexity
- Better code maintainability
- Follows Go naming best practices

## Quality Metrics

### Before v0.7.0
- Cyclomatic complexity: High in config and error handling
- Linting issues: Multiple gosec warnings, style issues
- Code organization: Large monolithic functions

### After v0.7.0
- Cyclomatic complexity: Reduced (15+ → 2 in error mapping)
- Linting issues: Clean (except golangci-lint version mismatch)
- Code organization: Focused, single-responsibility functions

## Notes

- **golangci-lint version**: Built with Go 1.23, project uses Go 1.24
  - Not a blocker: Tests pass, go vet clean, staticcheck clean
  - Can be addressed in CI/CD workflow by installing specific version
  
- **Staticcheck warnings**: Only in generated protobuf code (unrelated)

- **Test coverage**: Maintained at 45.8%

## Sign-off

- [x] All changes reviewed
- [x] All tests passing
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] Ready for release
