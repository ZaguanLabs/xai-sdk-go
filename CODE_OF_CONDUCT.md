# Code of Conduct

The xAI SDK for Go project is committed to fostering a welcoming, inclusive, and productive environment for contributors of all backgrounds. All participants are expected to adhere to the following guidelines:

## Our Standards

- Be respectful and considerate of others.
- Provide constructive feedback and accept constructive criticism gracefully.
- Stay focused on technical topics relevant to the project.
- Avoid harassment, discrimination, and personal attacks.
- Respect differing viewpoints and experiences.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to the maintainers via the contact information that will be published once the project reaches an initial release. In the meantime, please open a private issue or reach out directly to the maintainers.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. Participants who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be temporarily or permanently banned from the project.
